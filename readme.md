# SpeaKey #

This add-on adds a keyboard shortcut (Control+Escape) that toggle the SpeaKey mode.
When the SpeaKey mode is active, NVDA will read any key when you press it once. If you press the key twice, the key is passed to the application.

This addon is useful for people who are learning the keyboard and are not full confident when they are pressing a key.
